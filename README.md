##To-Do List

1)The first thing to do is working on adding more to the game aesthetics, making the text bigger and asteroids bigger. ✓

2)I also need to working on the menu making it more appealing this is something many of my testers said was needed. ✓

3)I want to work on giving the asteroids attributes so that when two asteroids collide they take the attributes and make a planet out of them.

4)Leaderboards, using LocalStorage I probably would be able to create a leaderboard easily.
