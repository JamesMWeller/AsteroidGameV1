#To-Do List
1)The first thing to do is working on adding more to the game aesthetics, making the text bigger and asteroids bigger.
2)I also need to working on the menu making it more appealing this is something many of my testers said was needed.
3)I want to work on giving the asteroids attributes so that when two asteroids collide they take the attributes and make a planet out of them.
4)Leaderboards, using LocalStorage I probably would be able to create a leaderboard easily.
